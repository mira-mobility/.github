## üöó About MIRA

MIRA Mobility is pioneering the future of automated driving through advanced teleoperation technology. We believe that the highest safety standards and absolute reliability are the core elements of tomorrow's automated, driverless mobility solutions.

### Our Mission
We are shaping the future of mobility to make our partners' business processes more efficient and productive, creating sustainable competitive advantages through our modular, scalable comprehensive concept of certified hardware and software that meets the highest requirements for functional safety and cybersecurity.

## üîß What We Do

### Teleoperation Technology
Teleoperation enables the operation and monitoring of one or more vehicles by a vehicle operator who is spatially decoupled and remotely controls the vehicle via a control station.

### Our Solutions

#### **TeleDriving**
The teleoperator continuously and directly guides a non-self-driving vehicle from a remote driving station. This spatial decoupling of driver and vehicle significantly increases the efficiency of deployed driving personnel and enables optimized vehicle operation and delivery.

#### **TeleAssist**
The teleoperator supports a self-driving, driverless vehicle in case of problems such as system failures or unsolvable driving tasks by taking over vehicle control. TeleAssist helps meet legal requirements for technical supervision of autonomous vehicles (L4/L5).
